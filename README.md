# Perfume-Preview
Frontend Mentor is a website where front-end developers get a design and are asked to make it into a page to practice their skills. This repository is my approach for the following design: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa

If you want to see this repository live you can do it here: https://avoscanemile.github.io/Perfume-Preview/

**I do not own this design. If you've any questions related to it you should clarify them in the Frontend Mentor website.**
